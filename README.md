I can help you with a general outline of the steps involved in a market basket analysis using Python, but I can't directly compile code files since I can't execute code on your local machine. However, I can provide you with code examples for each step. Here's a high-level outline of the process:

1.Data Preprocessing:
   - Load and clean the transaction data.
   - Transform the data into a suitable format for association analysis.

```python
# Example data preprocessing code
import pandas as pd

# Load transaction data
data = pd.read_csv('transaction_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data (e.g., remove duplicates, handle missing values)
data = data.drop_duplicates()
data = data.dropna()

# Transform data into a transaction format (list of lists)
transactions = data.groupby('order_id')['product_id'].apply(list).tolist()
```

2. Association Analysis:
   - Use a library like `mlxtend` to perform association analysis (Apriori algorithm).
   - Find frequent itemsets and association rules.

```python
# Example association analysis code
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import association_rules

# Create a one-hot encoded DataFrame
oht = pd.get_dummies(data['product_id'])

# Run the Apriori algorithm
frequent_itemsets = apriori(oht, min_support=0.01, use_colnames=True)

# Find association rules
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=1.0)

# Sort and display the rules
sorted_rules = rules.sort_values(by=['lift'], ascending=False)
print(sorted_rules)
```

3.Visualization and Interpretation:
   - Visualize the association rules and their metrics.
   - Interpret the results to gain market basket insights.

Please note that you'll need to install the necessary libraries like `pandas` and `mlxtend` using pip or conda if you haven't already.

This is a general guide, and you'll need to adapt it to your specific dataset and requirements. If you have code files and specific issues, feel free to share them for more detailed assistance.
